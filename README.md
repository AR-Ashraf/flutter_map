<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Flutter development is increasing day by day for its multi-platform flexibilities. In today's project I have developed a map app using google map API. The special part is that, I have customized the marker of the map like airbnb. This will help those who want to have customization in their maps.

If you are here because:
* You want to learn about implementing map feature in flutter using bloc pattern
* You don't want to roam around sites to learn map customization

Then you are at the right repo. Let's build something amazing then. If you get the time and love my repo then please consider giving it a star and follow :)


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
